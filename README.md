# Coding Repositories #

This repository is dedicated to showcasing my coding projects, specifically focused on creating various forms of art through coding.
Here, you'll find a collection of innovative and visually appealing creations, continuously updated with new and exciting pieces.


## Introduction ##

In this repository, I explore the intersection of coding and art. I believe that programming can be a powerful tool for expressing creativity and generating unique visual experiences. Through experimentation and combining different techniques, 
I aim to push the boundaries of what's possible and inspire others to explore the artistic side of coding.

## Art Projects

Here are some examples of the art projects you'll find in this repository:

- **Doraemon**
- **Tree**
- **Heart**
- 
I'll continue to update this repository regularly, introducing new projects and 
refining existing ones. Feel free to explore the code, experiment with it, and adapt it to your own artistic ideas.



## Usage

Each project within this repository will have its own dedicated folder, containing the source code, assets, and a README file with detailed instructions on how to run and use the project.

To get started with a specific project, navigate to its corresponding folder and follow the instructions provided in the README.

**I'll update this very soon.** It's kind of messy and unorganised as of now.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions from the community! If you have any ideas,
improvements, or errors for any of the projects in this repository, feel free to submit a pull request. 
If you'd like to suggest a new project or discuss an idea, please open an issue and let's have a conversation.


Thank you for visiting the Repository!
